# SwipeBrite

## Suffering from Covid _cabin fever_? Cure your ills with **SwipeBrite**!

Covid-safe good times await, just swipe right with [_SwipeBrite_](https://swipebritefrontend.herokuapp.com/)!

SwipeBrite uses an API and your current location to show you events happening near you.

SwipeBrite is similar to Tender (on mobile; desktop contains buttons):

- swipe right to save that event
- _since tastes can change from one day_, swipe left to merely not have that event show up for the remainder of the day
- swipe DOWN to never have that event show up again

- Be able to adjust mileage radius for pulling events
